### Phase 1 - Currently doing

### Phase 2 - Next Steps

### Phase 3 - Future Additions

## Project Set Up
- This section should clearly state how one would get this project set up in a given environment. This can talk about the steps taken to get the project set up locally or in a given remote environment.


### Prerequisites

3. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
4. Open a Pull Request


## Content Structure
This is where you explain the content structure, otherwise known as the Information Architecture (IA). There are a few parts to this, depending on how complicated and broad the project. Try to include relationships between files and services.

### Site Maps
- This is a diagram that looks like a tree with branches in a hierarchical structure. **It demonstrates how and where the website pages will be located.**


## Design
- The web development team needs guidance on the design style. For example, if there are brand guidelines, they will include:

## Functionality
- This section outlines how your project will work. For example, some sites have integrations with third-party APIs. These should be outlined in terms of how theyâ€™ll work and whatever other information is needed. This section may mirror/overalap/mingle with indepth code documentation.

## Usage
- This section should clearly state the intended usecase for this project and how to interact with it. This section could aid in developing tests for the product as well as uncover un-intended use cases.

## Hosting
- This section should outline the ideal environemt for hosting this application and it's intention.

## Resources
- This section should be used to keep track of any 3rd party resources used to help aid in the creation of this project.
