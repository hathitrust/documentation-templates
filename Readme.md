## About The Project
This repository will contain various templates to help document your projects. The templates can range from code based projects to infrastructure projects.

The goal of this repository is to give teams a very general and generic starting base to begin documenting their own projects.

## Usage
- Simply copy and paste these markdown files into your repositories `Readme.md` file and edit as you see fit!

Happy Documenting ðŸ¤©
